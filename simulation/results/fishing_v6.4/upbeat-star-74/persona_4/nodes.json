What do you all think?"], ["Kate", "I agree with John. We need to ensure the lake remains sustainable for all of us. How about we set a cap on the total amount of fish we can catch each month and divide it equally among us? This way, we can all benefit in the long run. For example, if we limit our total catch to 200 tons per month, each of us could catch 40 tons. What do you all think?"], ["Emma", "I appreciate the initiative, John and Kate. I agree that we need to be more mindful of our fishing practices to ensure the lake remains sustainable. However, I think we should also consider the natural reproduction rate of the fish. If we catch too much, the fish population won't have a chance to recover. How about we set a cap based on the reproduction rate and adjust our catches accordingly? For instance, if the lake can naturally replenish 200 tons of fish each month, we should aim to catch less than that to allow the population to grow. What do you all think?"], ["Jack", "I think we should try to understand how the fish reproduce and adjust accordingly. We should try to harvest less than needed.

My grandfather always emphasized the importance of respecting nature and ensuring that we leave enough for future generations. I think Emma and Jack have a good point about considering the natural reproduction rate of the fish. If we can get more information from the marine biologist Jack mentioned, we could set a more accurate cap that allows the fish population to recover and grow. In the meantime, I suggest we aim to catch significantly less than the lake's natural replenishment rate. Maybe we can start with a cap of 150 tons for next month and adjust as we learn more. What do you all think?"], ["John", "I think Luke's suggestion of starting with a cap of 150 tons for next month is a good starting point.

This way, we can make more informed decisions moving forward. Does everyone agree with this approach?"], ["Kate", "I think Luke's suggestion is a reasonable starting point. Setting a cap of 150 tons for February shows our commitment to sustainability while we gather more information. However, I also want to emphasize the importance of fairness and transparency in our decision-making process.
